# app_repo

This is an application with abilities to classify text, query a database of songs from spotify, or connect to your machine's camera.

The app began solely for the natural language processing functionality, and is not headed in a particular direction currently; One idea I have been tossing around is connecting machine audio to the application, so that the user can speak and then have the words classified as text.
